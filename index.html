    <h1>The Designer</h1>
    <p>I'm a jane-of-many-trades who spent years tinkering with HTML and CSS on several platforms before deciding to pour my design interests into the mix. I spent my college career designing for campus events and various t-shirt brands. After graduating from Oakwood University with a B.A. in Communication Media and a minor in Art, I moved back to New York City to pursue better career opportunities in design. I look forward to further exploring the intersections of web design, fashion eCommerce, and communication.
